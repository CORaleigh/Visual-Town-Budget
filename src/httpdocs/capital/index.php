        <h3>Capital Improvement Program</h3>
        The capital improvement program (CIP) is a five year plan that allocates
        limited financial resources to high priority needs. It is a primary mechanism for implementing the cityâ€™s
        long-term vision and strategic plan. The program proposes budgeting <strong>$167.6 million</strong> in capital spending for FY2017, and <strong>$1.21 billion</strong> over the next 5 years. The latter figure represents a 16% increase over last years capital budget. 
        The map below shares details of the CIP projects currently planned based on its location throughout the city.*

        <h3>Capital Projects at Various Locations</h3>

These projects primarily fall within the Parks and Recreation element and are not reflected on this map, but are instead shown in the table on our <a href="https://data.raleighnc.gov/d/rvdc-t75z" target="blank">open data site</a>.
