	      <p>Budget preparation affords departments the opportunity to reassess their goals and objectives and the strategies for accomplishing them.  Even though the proposed budget is presented City Council in May and adopted in June, its preparation begins at least six months prior with projections of City revenues, expenditures, and overall financial capacity. </p>

		The accounts of the City of Asheville are organized and operated on the basis of funds.  A fund is a fiscal and accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts comprised of assets, liabilities, fund equity, revenues, and expenses as appropriate.  Fund accounting segregates funds according to their intended purpose and is used to aid management in demonstrating compliance with finance-related legal and contractual provisions.
