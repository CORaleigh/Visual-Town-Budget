					<h1>About This Website</h1>
					<p>
					  This site is a collaborative volunteer effort between Code for Asheville and the City of Asheville. As an experimental approach to civic engagement and open government it has been released in conjunction with the City’s 2014/2015 Proposed Budget, and updated with the final 2014/2015 Adopted Budget. While this certainly is not presented as a final product it is, however, presented as a work in progress and, more importantly, as an invitation to participate. We hope that it offers some helpful functionality and sparks further collaboration between Code for Asheville, citizens, the City, and the press.
					</p>
					<p>
					  The functionality currently present at this site is focused primarily on the visualization of how the City of Asheville allocates and spends money. As citizens of Asheville we have an interest in how our tax dollars are collected and distributed. We hope to make this information just a little more accessible, presented in a fashion that both initiates questions and facilitates answers, and provides temporal context over the period of several years.
					</p>
