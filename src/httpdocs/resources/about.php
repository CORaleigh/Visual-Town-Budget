					<h1>About This Project</h1>
					<p>
This site, a volunteer collaboration between <a href="http://codeforasheville.org/" target="_blank">Code for
Asheville</a> and the <a href="http://www.ashevillenc.gov/" target="_blank">City of Asheville</a>, is an experiment in civic
engagement and open government that we are releasing in conjunction
with the City’s 2014/2015 Proposed Budget (and will update when the
final budget is adopted). The site is not intended to
be any kind of final product. We see it rather as a contribution to
the conversation within the Asheville community and between the
community and the government which serves it.
					</p>
					<p>
How our tax dollars are collected and spent fundamentally reflects our
community's values and so it is important for us, as citizens of
Asheville, to pay attention to that. For this reason our initial
efforts here have focused on making this information just a little 
more accessible and presenting it in a fashion that both gives rise
to questions and facilitates answers, while providing some
historical context.
